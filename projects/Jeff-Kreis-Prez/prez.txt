===PREZENTATION ENGINE

  Animated presentations can be created by extending VID to include a
  TIME and EFFECT dimension.  The presentation dialect allows you to
  create layouts that have animated effects. 

---Running the examples

  Included with the presentation engine is a simple presentation
  launcher script.  This script allows you to type in the name of a
  file that contains a presentation layout and then run it.  This
  allows you to make edits to the presentation as you go along,
  hitting the "START" button periodically to see the results.  When
  you are finished with your presentation, the presentation maker can
  save your script to run on its own.  The presentation package
  includes 10 short example scripts from this document in the
  directory prez-ex/ (t1.r - t10.r).  You can specify these examples
  in the file field of the presentation manager.  


A presentation has this basic structure:

size 400x400 [
     [  ;- first scene
         vid-styles 
     ]
     [ ;- second scene
         more-vid-styles 0:0:0 [effects]
     ]
]

or 
size 200x200 [
     ;- one and only one scene
]

Because the different items in the presentation may be moving around
the screen, you must specify a size for the presentation screen.
After specifying the size, the scenes follow.  You may have one block
for a single scene, or a series of blocks inside the block folling the
size declaration for multiple scenes.  When you use multiple scenes,
they will each be played one after another, the next one starting when
the previous one is done. 

The scenes take the same format as as VID layout.  Anything included
in the scene that is not subject to an appear time and an effect is
presented in the same way that LAYOUT would treat it, for example, the
following presentation:  (%prez-ex/t1.r)

    size 300x300 [
        backdrop black
        h3 white "test"
    ]

... would be equivalent to viewing this layout:

    view layout/size [backdrop black h3 white "test"] 300x300

If you placed the presentation above in a file called tst.r, started
make-prez and typed tst.r in the file field and pressed start you
should see the same thing as you would if you typed into the console
the one line viewed layout that follows the presentation.

What this means is that items that you place in your scene will be
originally placed on the page in the same easy fashion that layout
places them.  You can use AT and ACROSS, BELOW, and GUIDE as you
normally do in LAYOUT. 

Basically the idea of the presentation engine is you can take any VID
element and specify its appear time, any number of animated effects to
be applied to it, each effect containing a start time for the effect
and a duration of the effect and possibly some other information.

Here is a simple example of a VID element that has an appear time and
an effect applied to it:

    txt font-size 20 "Hello" 0:0:0 [0:0:2 fade green 0:0:9]

The above would create the text "Hello", which would appear at 0
seconds after the start of the presentation.  Two seconds after the
text appears it starts to fade to green taking nine seconds to make
the transition.  You would see the above example by placing it within
a scene in the presentation dialect, as below:  (t2.r)

size 100x50 [
    txt font-size 20 "Hello" 0:0:0 [0:0:2 fade green 0:0:9]
]

Currently the available effects are: FADE, FADE-UP, MOVE, ADD-EFFECTS,
GO, and GROW.  GROW can also cause make an element shrink if provided
with a pair that is smaller than the VID element being
effected. FADE-UP is used for images, because images currently use the
image effect BRIGHTEN to accomplish their fades (which means they
won't look so hot on non black or white backgrounds.)  GO means to
move the element to an absolute location in the page (specified as a
pair).  MOVE means to move the element in a given direction (also
specified as a pair, usually pairs with small numbers like: 1x0 (one
pixel to the right) -3x3 (three pixels left, three pixels down)
etc...  ADD-EFFECTS will be covered at the end of this document.

Here is a simple presentation:  (t3.r)

size 300x150 [
    backdrop black
    title white "Simple Presentation"
    h1 black "Up we go"   0:0:0 [0:0:2 fade white 0:0:7]
    h3 white "Fade to black" 0:0:0 [0:0:2 fade 0:0:7]
]

If you run the above presentation from make-prez, you should see the
black backdrop, the white title text, and the text "Fade to black".
Two seconds after the scene starts, the "Fade to black" text will
start to do just that (taking seven seconds to complete the fade).
Likewise, the text "Up we go" will fade from black to white, two
seconds after the scene starts taking seven seconds to complete the
fade.

More than one animated effect can be applied to an item at a time.
Here is an example of text that moves and fades simultaneously: (t4.r)

size 300x150 [
        backdrop blue
        h2 white "So much to do so..."
        h3 white "Off to work I go..." 0:0:0 [
            0:0:1 move 1x0 0:0:5 0:0:1 fade blue 0:0:5
        ]
]

The text "Off to work I go..." will begin to move to the right (1x0)
one second after appearing.  The text will continue to move to the
right for five seconds.  Also one second after the "off to work" text
appears it will begin to fade to blue taking five seconds to complete
its fade. 

Of course, effects can be timed to occur sequentially as well, as in
the following example:  (t5.r)

size 300x150 [
     backdrop yellow 0:0:0 [0:0:8 fade black 0:0:5]
     h2 "Time flies" 0:0:1 [
         0:0:0 go 200x100 0:0:2         
         0:0:2 go 50x100  0:0:2
         0:0:4 go 200x20  0:0:2
         0:0:6 go 20x20   0:0:2
         0:0:8 fade yellow 0:0:5
     ]
]

The above example shows 
As you see, above, the start times and durations of the four different
GO effects are evenly spaced at for two seconds.  

Custom effects can be made in the presentation dialect if you supply
an "effects" block first.  An effects block takes the form of the word
'effects followed by a block containing the name of a custom effect
followed by one or more names of effects that the custom effect is
derived from with a block specifying preset values for the custom
effect.  Once a custom effect is defined, it may be refered to after
specifying the appear time for an element. Here is an example of
creating and using a custom effect:  (t6.r)

effects [
    qfade fade [fade-to: 140.0.0 duration: 0:0:2]
]
size 300x70 [
     backdrop 140.0.0 across
     h1 white     "Lights!" 0:0:1 qfade
     h1 yellow    "Camera!" 0:0:2 qfade
     h1 0.255.255 "Action!" 0:0:3 qfade
]

The above example defines a custom effect, QFADE. QFADE is derived
from FADE taking two seconds to fade to the color 140.0.0.  The
default start time is 0 seconds.  QFADE can then be used in the
presentation layout.  The above presentation creates a dark red
background.  One second after starting the words "Lights! Camera!
Action!" appear one second appart (each a different color to begin
with) and each word fades to the background color two seconds after it
appears.

A custom effect can be derived from more than one effect, allowing a
series of effects to be specified.  Here is an example of a custom
effect which used more than one base effect:  (t7.r)

effects [ 
    slow-fade-blue fade [fade-to: blue duration: 0:0:8]
    slow-fade-blue-move-up fade [fade-to: blue duration: 0:0:8] 
        move [start: 0:0:2 xy: 0x-2 duration: 0:0:8]
]
size 300x300 [
    backdrop white
    at 50x50 title "I feel blue" 0:0:1 slow-fade-blue
    at 100x250 h1 "Up up and away!" 0:0:2 slow-fade-blue-move-up
]

The slow-fade-blue-move-up effect will fade to blue, two seconds after
the VID element appears that is being effected. It will start to move
up (0x-2) for 8 seconds.  

Each custom effect is derived from one or more base effects, specified
after declaring the effect, along with a block containing any of the
following 

    start:       (time!)
    fade-to:     (tuple!)
    xy:          (pair!)
    fade-facet:  ('text , 'body , 'edge or 'full)
    duration:    (time!)
    effects:     (block!)

FADE-FACET is either 'text, 'body, 'edge or 'full which specifies
which facet of the VID item you would like the effect to apply to
(allowing you to independently fade an element's text or it's body,
edge, or all of them together).

Here is an example of fading a button's text to one color, while
fading the button's body to a different color: (t8.r)

effects [
    crazy-button fade [
        fade-to: yellow duration: 0:0:5 fade-facet: 'text
    ] fade [
        fade-to: 200.30.0 duration: 0:0:4 fade-facet: 'body
    ]
]
size 250x80 [
    backdrop 50.90.130
    across 
    button "Click" [request/ok "bingo!"] 0:0:0 crazy-button
    button "me" [request/ok "Zip!"] 0:0:0 crazy-button
]

Yes, the buttons in the above presentation work. All VID elements used
in a presentation will be fully functional.

---Incremental Effects

You can incrementally apply some effects to a VID element.  The
effects are applied one after another evenly spaced by the duration
time.  Here is a fun example:  (t9.r)

size 300x300 [
   origin 0x0
   image %space.jpg 300x300 0:0:0 [
       0:0:1 add-effects [
           [blur]
           [reflect -1x1]
           [brighten 100]
           [colorize 200.120.10]
           [tint -120]
           [gradcol 1x1 255.255.255 0.0.0]
           [contrast 15]
           [draw [pen white text 20x25 "Groovy"]]
       ] 0:0:1
   ]
]

You may also specify the times for things to occur before each effect
chunk block.  For example:  (t10.r)


size 300x300 [
   origin 0x0
   image %space.jpg 300x300 0:0:0 [
       0:0:1 add-effects [
           0:0:0.5   [blur]
           0:0:1     [reflect -1x1]
           0:0:2     [colorize 200.120.10]
           0:0:4     [tint -120]
           0:0:2.5   [gradcol 1x1 255.255.255 0.0.0]
           0:0:4     [contrast 15]
           0:0:2     [draw [pen white text 20x45 "Groovy"]]
           0:0:1     [draw [pen white line 20x60 80x60]]
           0:0:2     [draw [pen red circle 150x150 90]]
       ] 0:0:1
       0:0:6 fade 0:0:1
   ]
]

The above example shows how ADD-EFFECTS allows you to have effects
apply at varying times.  Some of the effect chunks above are specified
for the same time so they will occur simultaneously.  You can also
see that you can use DRAW effects incrementally. 

===CURRENT LIMITATIONS

Right now, using STYLE in a layout seems to goof up the presentation
engine which is an unfortunate limitation. A little hacking should
remedy the problem. 

Another important limitation is that the custom effects can't accept
arguments in the scene layout which makes them static.  Custom effects
should be able to accept different facet arguments in much the same
manner as VID does. This limitation to custom effects also should be
fixable with a little more work.

One other issue with custom effects is that one custom effect can not
be defined and then subsequently used as the base effect for another
custom effect.  Yet a little more hacking can fix that.

Lastly, more effects are needed.  Planned effects include a simple
incremental drawing ability, transitional effects between scenes, and
more.
